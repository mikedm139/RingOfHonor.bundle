DISCLAIMER - READ THIS!
This software is provided AS-IS, without any warranty, express or implied.  I am not responsible for any damages to any hardware or data.

WHAT IS THIS?
This is a plugin for the Plex Media Server software, to enable the user to view videos from rohwrestling.com (TV episodes and video galleries and whatnot) in the Plex interface.  You must be running Plex Media Server and an appropriate frontend in order to use this plugin; if you do not have this currently installed, you can download it from www.plexapp.com.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
* If you don't already have one, create a MyROH account at rohwrestling.com.  General Admission accounts are free, and they are all that is currently supported (you should be able to use the plugin with a Ringside account, but this is untested, and at any rate, it will not give you the Ringside exclusive content).
* Extract the RingOfHonor.bundle folder to your Plex plugins directory.  For Windows 7 users, this should be %PROFILEPATH%\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
* Open Plex, and navigate to Video Channels (if you are not using the MediaStream skin, this may be named differently).  Select the Ring of Honor channel.
* Select Preferences from the main menu, and enter your username (email address) and password for your MyROH account.

WHAT'S SUPPORTED:
* The latest episode of ROH TV
* ROH's Youtube channel

WHAT'S NOT:
* Ringside exclusive content (this will be supported in a later version)
* All freely-available video galleries from the site
* iPPV's (this may not be supported in this plugin)

THANKS:
* The Plex dev team, of course, for making a great piece of media center software as well as for the Plex plugin kickstarter, which supplied the Youtube code.
* IanB! from the Plex forums for his development walkthrough.
* sander1 from the Plex forums for helping me with a couple of newbie issues.
